# Currently under construction

# The CBU CSSE Club Project Euler Repo
This is where we will share code and work on Project Euler problems.

# Folder Structure Guidelines

Problem folders are named "euler_001" or "euler_099" based on what problem it is used for. Each shall contain a "NNN.txt" where n is the problem number and the text file contains the problem description. There should one or two other top-level files: "euler_nnn.sh" and /or "euler_nnn.bat" which are *nix and windows shell scripts, respectively.
TL;DR There should be one script per problem that makes it easy for anyone to just run it and see the code at work.

Visualization:
